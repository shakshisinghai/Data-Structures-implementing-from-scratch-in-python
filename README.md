## Graphs: 
**A non-linear data structure consisting of vertex and edges**
### **Functionality Implemented :**
1. Adjacency list 
  -Implemented using dictionary:
    - keys: interger representing vertex
    - Values: set representing connection with that vertex
2. Directed graph
3. Undirected graph
4. Insert Edge
5. Delete Edge
6. BFS
7. DFS
8. Disconnect Vertex
9. Indegree
10. Outdegree


## Binary tree:
### **Functionality Implemented :**
1. CreateBT
2. Insert Element
3. Traverse:  IN, PRE, POST
4. Find Element
5. Delete Element
6. Height
7. BFS
8. DFS
9. Is Balanced
10. Balance()
