# Data-Structures-implementing-from-scratch-in-python
## Graphs: 
**A non-linear data structure consisting of vertex and edges**
#### **Functionality Implemented :**
1. Adjacency list 
  -Implemented using dictionary:
    - keys: interger representing vertex
    - Values: set representing connection with that vertex
2. Directed graph
3. Undirected graph
4. Insert Edge
5. Delete Edge
6. BFS
7. DFS
8. Disconnect Vertex
9. Indegree
10. Outdegree
